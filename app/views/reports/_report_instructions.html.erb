<b>Step 1: Select Starting Person</b><br>
<p>First, select the starting person for the report. This will be the root person for the report, regardless of the report type.
Select 'Self' to set the current user as the starting person. Select 'Other' to open 
another field where you can enter a FamilySearch Person Identifier (i.e. KLMN-OPQ). 
To find a specific FamilySearch Person Identifier, either run a larger-scope report (such as Direct Line All)
and locate the Person Identifier you would like to use, or login to FamilySearch and use the site's search function.
